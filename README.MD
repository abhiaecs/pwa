# A simple example PWA
This project was built as part of a demo on PWA at ESummit 2k18, Hyderabad

# Usage
Run `npm install` (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for that) to install the development server which will serve the `public` folder.

Once that command finished, start the server via `npm start` and view the app at [localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)
